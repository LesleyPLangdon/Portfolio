        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I am Lesley Langdon, wife, mother, self-trained chef, weekend horticulturist, and cum laude graduate pursuing a new career in computer science and a MBA while dreaming of hiking the Appalachian Trail one day.  After careers as a restaurant manager and realtor I would like to combine my new skills with my existing tallents to fulfill my passion for helping others find success.  I am actively looking for employment as a data analyst, project manager, or small business consultant. </p>

        <p>I achieved the position of general manager for Chili's restaurants after climbing the ranks from line cook up through management.  I was the general manager of a culinary test restaurant well as a management training location.  I was trusted with our newest menu items and our newest managers, responsibilities that I took very seriously.  The way that I ran my restaurant affected not only my staff and our guests but also the staff and guests of almost 20 other restaurants and the careers of up to a dozen managers a year.  From my time as a restaurant manager, I learned leadership, organization, managing and understanding budgets, and to take responsibility for everything that happened under my charge.  As rewarding as my career as a restaurant manager was, I always knew that it was not the career I wanted to eventually retire from.</p>
        <p>About 10 years ago I made the leap, left the security of a salary position as a restaurant manager and dove headfirst into real estate.  It was exciting.  Every deal is different.  At times I helped people make the single most significant purchase of their lives, other times I took on the responsibility of ensuring that a seller got the most they could out of the sale of their home.  Selling real estate is a tremendous responsibility.  I learned to negotiate and to work with different types of people.  Possibly most valuable, I learned to really listen to what my client wanted and what they needed.  I was working in real estate at an exciting time.  Technology was constantly changing the way we marketed properties and the way we conducted business.  Over time, I became the go to person for technology questions.  Whether it was a problem with their personal computer, help setting up their social media or guidance managing their website I would do whatever I could to help out the other agents in my company.  That was the start of what would become my pursuit of a career in technology.</p>
        <p>I continued to work as a realtor while I began pursuing my computer science degree. After my daughter was born, I reduced my hours a bit, only working with my investors and other repeat clients so I could keep my daughter with me. I felt so blessed to be in an industry that afforded me the opportunity to juggle it all. That became a more difficult task as my daughter got older. She has a medical condition that made us uncomfortable sending her to daycare when she was so young. In 2019 I continued to reduce my work hours and eventually left real estate to focus on my education and my daughter. </p>
        <p>Fast forward to 2021, I have completed my BS in computer science, began working towards my MBA, my daughter is ready for school, and I am excited to get to work. Feel free to browse around my site. You will find the history of my <a href="missionstatement.html">personal mission statement</a> and how it guides me forward.
