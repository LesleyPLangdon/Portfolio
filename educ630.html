        <div id="aboutMe"><p>Hi and welcome! I am Lesley Langdon, wife, mother, self-trained chef, weekend horticulturist, and computer science educator pursuing a Doctor of Education degree while dreaming of hiking the Appalachian Trail one day.  After careers as a restaurant manager, realtor, and technology consultant, I was able to fulfill my passion for helping others find success by moving into education.
        </p><p>I live South Jersey (if you know, you know) with my wife, 7-year-old daughter, and our spoiled little bunny. My three greatest joys are my family, teaching, and becoming a better teacher. I am pursuing my Doctor of Education degree (EdD) with a technology concentration. I love exploring new edtech tools.
        </p><p>My favorite technologies are those that make the planning and administrative part of my job easier and those that facilitate individualized student learning. In the pages of this blog, you will learn about some of my favorites. Magic School is a website with dozens of tools to assist educators, tools that help with lesson plans, and multiple-choice questions. It can even generate a quote or joke of the day based on a particular topic. Tools for student learning are developing quickly. I am currently watching companies that are working on platforms that will analyze student learning and adapt delivery methods to produce the best outcomes.

        <h1>Philosophy of Education</h1>

            <p>	My motivation for entering the field of education was my personal and professional mission statement: to encourage, guide, and support others on their path to success (Langdon, 2021). As I prepared to return to work after the birth of my daughter and the passing of the Covid-19 pandemic I reflected on my previous careers and I prayed. I prayed that God would lead me down a path that would combine the aspects of my time in restaurant management, real estate, and business consulting that I found most fulfilling into a new career that I could be passionate about. In Paul’s first letter to the Thessalonians he says “Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing” (RSV, 1952/2023, 1 Thessalonians 5:11). It was during this time of prayer and reflection that I realized that with each career the times that brought me the most joy were the times that I helped others find success. As a restaurant manager I would hire young high school students who would often stay with me through college and move on to their dream jobs as a result of the work ethic and training they received during their time with me. In real estate, I developed a niche business working with new investors. Being able to guide them through the process and seeing the relief mixed with joy on their faces when we settled on the sale of their first flipped house gave me so much satisfaction. I went into business consulting because I met the owner of a small restaurant who was drowning as he tried to keep up with all the technology and the expectations for a social media and web presence. I like helping people get where they want to go in their careers. I wrote down my mission statement and looked at it every day as I searched for a clear path. At some point education became the obvious choice.</p> 
            <p>    I believe that as an educator my primary goal is to help my students be successful. When I started teaching I thought that would be measured in grades but there is so much more to it. Success means different things to different students. Technology helps us to meet students where they are while challenging them to be more. Luke 2 tells the story of Jesus at the temple in Jeruselem. Verse 46 says “after three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions” (RSV,  1952/2023, Luke 2:46). What would have happened if the Rabbis had brushed him off as just a kid? What if they didn’t respect his curiosity? Technology helps us meet our students where they are. The advanced and curious can work on higher level material while the struggling can be challenged without being discouraged.</p> 
            <p>    Technology doesn’t just provide opportunities to teach in new and exciting ways that are familiar to our students, it helps us fullfil our basic obligations as educators. Titus 2:7 says “Show yourself in all respects a model of good deeds, and in your teaching show integrity, gravity” (RSV, 1952/2023, Titus 2:7). I believe this is telling us as educators that we must use the tools available to us, even if we are not always completely comfortable with them, to provide the best education we can. It may take extra effort to get acquainted with a new technology but if the end result is a better education for our students it is our obligation to put in that effort.</p> 
            <p>    It can be challenging to look at the use of technology from a biblical standpoint until one realizes that we apply biblical teachings to modern situations every day. Through the bible, God teaches us to help eachother. Jesus was repeatedly called teacher. As educators we are called not only to share our knowledge but to do so in a way that our students will be receptive to it. Technology is a tool that modern day educators can, and I would suggest must, use to reach today’s students in a way that is approachable and familiar to them.</p>

            <p>This video walks through the process of setting up a juicemind quiz. Juicemind quizzes don't have some of the team play features you get with Kahoot! but,
                it has other features that enhance my computer science quizzes.
