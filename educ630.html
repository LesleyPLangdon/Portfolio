        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <div id="630AboutMe">
        <div id="amPic"></div>
        <div id="aboutMe"><p>Hi and welcome! I am Lesley Langdon, wife, mother, self-trained chef, weekend horticulturist, and computer science educator pursuing a Doctor of Education degree while dreaming of hiking the Appalachian Trail one day.  After careers as a restaurant manager, realtor, and technology consultant, I was able to fulfill my passion for helping others find success by moving into education.
        </p><p>I live South Jersey (if you know, you know) with my wife, 7-year-old daughter, and our spoiled little bunny. My three greatest joys are my family, teaching, and becoming a better teacher. I am pursuing my Doctor of Education degree (EdD) with a technology concentration. I love exploring new edtech tools.
        </p><p>My favorite technologies are those that make the planning and administrative part of my job easier and those that facilitate individualized student learning. In the pages of this blog, you will learn about some of my favorites. Magic School is a website with dozens of tools to assist educators, tools that help with lesson plans, and multiple-choice questions. It can even generate a quote or joke of the day based on a particular topic. Tools for student learning are developing quickly. I am currently watching companies that are working on platforms that will analyze student learning and adapt delivery methods to produce the best outcomes.
