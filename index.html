        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I am Lesley Langdon, wife, mother, self-trained chef, weekend horticulturist, and computer science educator pursuing an MBA while dreaming of hiking the Appalachian Trail one day.  After careers as a restaurant manager, realtor, and technology consultant, I was able to fulfill my passion for helping others find success by moving into education. </p>

        <h1>MISSION STATEMENT</h1>
        <h4>Personal mission statement: to encourage, guide, and support others on their path to success.</h4>
        <p>This applies to my family, clients, colleagues, and direct reports. In my home, we encourage each other to follow our dreams, whatever they are. Right now, my daughter wants to be a princess. It wouldn’t be my first choice for her, but I wanted to know more so I asked her why. Her 4-year-old response, “because they help people”. Talk about a proud mom moment. Anyway, I hope in time she realizes that she doesn’t need to marry Archie or Louis to help people, but I fully support her dreams.</p>
        <p>I developed this mission statement by looking back at my career and
            reflecting on what was most important to me in each position I held. I
            realized that helping others achieve success was a common thread and
            one that I am proud of. Now, as an educator, I get to live my mission every day and I could not feel more blessed to get to spend my days with students excited about a future in Computer Science. </p>
