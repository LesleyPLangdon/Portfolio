                <h1>MISSION STATEMENT</h1>
                <h4>Personal mission statement: to encourage, guide, and support others in their path to success.</h4>
                <p>This applies to my family, clients, colleagues, and direct reports. In my home, we encourage each other to follow our dreams, whatever they are. Right now, my daughter wants to be a princess. It wouldn’t be my first choice for her, but I wanted to know more so I asked her why. Her 4-year-old response, “because they help people”. Talk about a proud mom moment. Anyway, I hope in time she realizes that she doesn’t need to marry Archie or Louis to help people, but I fully support her dreams.</p>
                <p>I developed this mission statement by looking back at my career and reflecting on what was most important to me in each position I held. I realized that helping others achieve success was a common thread and one that I am proud of. Before I talk more about how this trait showed itself in prior roles, I would like to talk about how I see it moving forward. There are three positions I am currently interested in pursuing: project manager, data analyst, and small business consultant. In some ways they are very different, but they all utilize my skills to help others achieve their goals. As a project manager I would use my leadership and organizational skills to help an organization by efficiently facilitating any type of project. As a data analyst I would call on my analytical and technological skills to help an organization understand their data and utilize it to make better business decisions. As a small business consultant, I would pull together all my skills, but especially my problem-solving skills, to help a small business find ways to run smoother and more efficiently taking advantage of technologies and tools they may not be familiar with. </p>

                    <p id="fullms">As a realtor, first time investors were some of my favorite clients. I started in real estate not long after the housing bubble burst. Short sales and foreclosures were a large percentage of the deals we closed, and they impacted my business in two ways. First, I worked with several first-time investors. I helped them find a good deal on a property, provided market analysis for a renovated property, and helped them sell or rent the completed flip. Second, I assisted quite a few people who had lost their homes either by negotiating the short sale of their home or by finding them a rental. The clients looking for rentals required a lot of diligence on my part to make sure that a prospective landlord could be comfortable and confident renting to them. I took my role as a huge responsibility and I was thrilled to be able to help people start over.</p>
                    <p>The first aspect that drew me to restaurant work was making customers happy. One of my first jobs was as a cook in a center city Philadelphia restaurant with an open kitchen, I could see the food I had prepared go to the tables and see the guests enjoying their meals. To put out a product that made people happy was a great honor. As I moved into supervisory and management positions, I realized I could get that same level of joy by helping those around me be successful. That open kitchen restaurant I spoke of closed three years after opening (no fault of the restaurant, it was a corporate decision to scale back the number of stores). The moment we got the news I began an initiative to help the staff find employment. I contacted every restaurant in a five city block radius to find out who was hiring. The next morning, I had a chart posted showing who was hiring, for which positions, who they should talk to, and when the best time was to stop by to get an on-the-spot interview. When we closed a week later, everyone who wanted a job had a job. </p>
                    <p>Jumping forward to my time at Chili’s I was the general manager of a management training locations. My location was one of two or three (depending on the year) training locations to cover our 14+ restaurants. I was always proud of the feedback I received from the general managers of the stores my trainees were sent to. They were consistently happy with the knowledge and leadership skills these new managers had acquired while training under my supervision. I also consistently sent multiple hourly trainers to new store openings. I feel that the most important step in developing new leaders is to understand that they want to be leaders. There could be a perfect employee, someone who is always on time, excellent at their job, and helpful in every way who has no interest in the responsibility that comes with being a supervisor. There could also be an average employee, someone who tries everyday but struggles with some aspects of the job, who wants to be a manager one day. In a case like this, I would show the perfect employee all the appreciation I can with verbal gratitude, scheduling preference, and a bit of autonomy while focusing on developing the average employee who wants more. It is the same with managers. I have worked with assistant managers who want to be assistant managers and others who strive to get promoted. A good mentor and leader will meet them on their level and develop a plan that suits their goals. This is what I always endeavor to do. </p>
